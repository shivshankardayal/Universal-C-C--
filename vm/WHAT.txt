What Is IVM
_____________________


IVM is a compiler and virtual machine that enables one to write C and
C++ programs that can be run on any machine that supports the virtual machine.

The speed of the virtual machine is fast enough to run 3D video games in
real time, without the need for JIT compilation. JIT compilation could help,
but is not necessary. For this reason, ports should be very quick and cost
effective. Download our DOOM port and check it out for yourself!

This release of IVM supports  standard C/C++ libraries, most of POSIX 
(completion in process now), the NetBSD libraries, X Windows and Motif. As 
a result, many current applications can be compiled and operated with 
IVM.

We have provided an OpenGL port, to aid in the development of high-speed
3D video applications targetted for portable internet use.

We will also be providing a port of Wine and its relatives to aid in porting
of Windows applications to IVM.

Other platform ports such as Windows, as well as browser ports, 
new libraries, etc. will follow.

IVM is very portable, allowing quick ports to new hardware. It is
open-source, allowing easy customization and testing. Because it is standard
C/C++, there is no need to rewrite code in one of the new languages to make
your product portable. Hence, it reduces costs of porting existing programs, 
and does not have a learning curve associated with new products.

Our vision of the future of IVM is to take it to the Internet 
completely, allowing applications to be loaded and operated
straight from the Internet, as well as accessing online user resources, 
such as files. We see the ability to virtualize the computer
itself, allowing programs and files to be operated from a television or
cable setbox, thus opening applications and games to previously 
unpentrated audiences.

We think IVM  will aid many developers to release their new products
swiftly and in a cost-effective way. They can be reaping the benefits of an
already released product, while their competition is still struggling with
learning curves and complete rewrites in new languages that simply 
are not needed.

With the ability to run portable, high-speed software such as video games,
developers will also attract larger audiences to their product. Bringing
standard business and home targetted applications to the Internet will be
very quick and cost-effective and potentially could enable previously 
untapped markets. 

We also believe IVM will aid the open-source community in its many
innovations in establishing new standards and levels of quality on the 
Internet. They brought Linux and BSD to the world. We are curious to see 
what they will do with this.

What is IVM?

We believe it is the future of The New Internet...
