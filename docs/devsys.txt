THIS DOC NEEDS TO BE REDONE ... THIS IS QUICK AND DIRTY

To build libraries or compiler (lib,xpm,xc,gcc) you will need the library/compiler
 plus the includes all on the same level. It is recommended that you use
the entire CVS source tree to build with. So your directory might look like:
	
(directory of ivm)
	lib
	gcc
	xc
	xpm
	include

This stuff will NOT compile unless the include directory is sitting at 
the root.
