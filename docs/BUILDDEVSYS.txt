Compilation and installation of Internet C++ Development System.

You must be SU to install these various components. 
You must install in the order listed.

Also, /usr/local/bin MUST be in your PATH variable.



IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE /usr/local/bin IS IN YOUR PATH VARIABLE BEFORE YOU ATTEMPT
THIS BUILD

INSTALLATION of the Internet C++ development system:
####################################################

You must have a directory set up with the following directories set up:

	gcc
	include
	lib
	xc
	xpm

To build and install igcc:

	cd gcc
	make

igcc will be installed in several directories at /usr/local/internetc.
links to the binaries are set in /usr/local/bin, so to use igcc, etc.
you will need /usr/local/bin in your PATH variable.

To build libraries:

	cd lib
	make
	make install

the libraries will be installed at /usr/local/internetc/lib


To build the X libraries:

	cd xc
	make
	make install


To build the XPM libraries:

	cd xc
	make
	make install




After building and installing the gcc, libraries, and the virtual machine
(icvm) is installed in /bin, you may compile and run
Internet C++ programs. Internet C++ uses a shell header at the beginning of it's executables,
so it is only necessary to type the name of the command to run it.


For instance, to compile a program called testit:

	igcc -O2 testit.c -o testit

to run the program:
	
	./testit

To compile a program using the stdc++ libraries use:

	ig++ -O2 program.cc -o program

It is not necessary to compile C++ programs using ig++ if you are not using
IO streams or other standard C++ features. Most C++ programs will compile
and run just fine using igcc.

Also note that the X11 libraries are installed. These will be a standard
part of Internet c++.
