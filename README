This Source Code Release is very raw. You will have to build both the
virtual machine and the compiler/libaries.

See README.TXT in vm for instructions on how to build the virtual machine
See BUILDDEVSYS.txt in gcc for instructions on how to compile GCC and libraries.


The demos in xdemo and gldemo can be built by just typing 'make', once
the vm and gcc/libraries have been built and installed.
