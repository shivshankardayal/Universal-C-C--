This will build and install the icvm C/C++ compiler and binutilities.

You will have to be root to make this and also have /usr/local/bin
set as part of your path variable, before you start.

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE /usr/local/bin IS IN YOUR PATH VARIABLE BEFORE YOU ATTEMPT
THIS BUILD

To build, enter this directory and type:

	make

The binutils will build first, then the compiler.
The install will occur in /usr/local/icvm with links to the binaries in
/usr/local/bin.

The links are important for the success of gcc, as it calls the binutils while 
it is building.

There are no libraries installed yet, but you can test by typing

	igcc -S test.c

You should be able to edit and view the machine language file test.s.



All commands built for icvm will be prepended by 'i'.

For instance, igcc, ias, istrip, ig++, ild, etc.
