@node ESA/390 Notes
@section Notes
As a back end for @sc{gnu} @sc{cc} @code{@value{AS}} has been tested 
but should still be considered experimental.  It will not work with 
HLASM-style assembly because it supports only a small subset of the 
HLASM directives.  Note that that only ELF-style binary file formats are
supported; none of the usual MVS/VM/OE/USS object file formats are
supported.

The ESA/390 @code{@value{AS}} port generates only a 31-bit relocation;
many more are available in the ELF object file format but are not
supported, and may fail silently.

@node ESA/390 Options
@section Options
@code{@value{AS}} has no machine-dependent command-line options for the ESA/390.

@cindex ESA/390 Syntax
@node ESA/390 Syntax
@section Syntax
The opcode/operand syntax follows the ESA/390 Principles of Operation
manual; assembler directives and general syntax are loosely based on the 
prevailing AT&T/SVR4/ELF/Solaris style notation.  HLASM-style directives
are @emph{not} supported for the most part, with the exception of those 
described herein.

A leading dot in front of directives is optional, and teh case of
directives is ignored; thus for example, .using and USING have the same
effect.

A colon may immediately follow a label definition.  This is
simply for compatibility with how most assembly language programmers
write code.

@samp{#} is the line comment character.

@samp{;} can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.

Since @samp{$} has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

Registers can be given the symbolic names r0..r15, fp0, fp2, fp4, fp6.
By using thesse symbolic names, @code{@value{AS}} can detect simple 
syntax errors. The name rarg or r.arg is a synonym for r11, rtca or r.tca
for r12, sp, r.sp, dsa r.dsa for r13, lr or r.lr for r14, rbase or r.base 
for r3 and rpgt or r.pgt for r4.

@samp{*} is the current location counter.  Unlike @samp{.} it is always
relative to the last USING directive.  Note that this means that 
expressions cannot use multiplication, as any occurence of @samp{*}
will be interpreted as a location counter.

All labels are relative to the last USING.  Thus, branches to a label 
always imply the use of base+displacement.

Many of the usual forms of address constants / address literals 
are supported.  Thus,
@example
	.using	*,r3
	L	r15,=A(some_routine)
	LM	r6,r7,=V(some_longlong_extern)
	A	r1,=F'12'
	AH	r0,=H'42'
	ME	r6,=E'3.1416'
	MD	r6,=D'3.14159265358979'
	O	r6,=XL4'cacad0d0'
	.ltorg
@end example
should all behave as expected: that is, an entry in the literal
pool will be created (or reused if it already exists), and the 
instruction operands will be the displacement into the literal pool
using the current base register (as last declared with the @code{.using}
directive).

@node ESA/390 Floating Point
@section Floating Point
@cindex floating point, ESA/390 (@sc{ieee})
@cindex ESA/390 floating point (@sc{ieee})
The assembler generates only @sc{ieee} floating-point numbers.  The older
floiating point formats are not supported.


@node ESA/390 Directives
@section ESA/390 Assembler Directives

@code{@value{AS}} for the ESA/390 supports all of the standard ELF/SVR4 
assembler directives that are documented in the main part of this
documentation.  Several additional directives are supported in order
to implement the ESA/390 addressing model.  The most important of these
are @code{.using} and @code{.ltorg}

@cindex ESA/390-only directives
These are the additional directives in @code{@value{AS}} for the ESA/390:

@table @code
@item .dc 
A small subset of the usual DC directive is supported.

@item .drop @var{regno}
Stop using @var{regno} as the base register.

@item .ebcdic @var{string}
Emit the EBCDIC equivalent of the indicated string.  The emitted string
will be null terminated.  Note that the directives @code{.string} etc. emit
ascii strings by default.

@item EQU 
The standard HLASM-style EQU directive is not supported; however, the 
standard @code{@value{AS}} directive .equ can be used to the same effect.

@item .ltorg 
Dump the literal pool accumulated so far; begin a new literal pool.

@item .using @var{expr},@var{regno}
Use @var{regno} as the base register for all subsequent RX, RS, and SS form
instructions. The @var{expr} will be evaluated to obtain the base address;
usually, @var{expr} will merely be @samp{*}.
